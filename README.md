## Findings and Reccomendations

### The United States Kickstarter Market
Analysis of the data has shown that Theaters are the largest Kickstarter category in the United States. Out of the 912 Theater Kickstarters, 512 were successful (**58% success rate**). In regards to funding goals,  ![US Theaters Chart Analysis](https://github.com/Mishkanian/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Module-1-chart1.svg)

### United States Kickstarter Plays
As a more specific category of "Theaters," Plays saw a slightly higher success rate in the United States. Of the 671 Plays Kickstarters, 412 were successful (**62% success rate**).

### The Great Britain Market

Louise has shown slight interest in entering the Great Britain market with a musical play. Unfortunately, musical Kickstarters in Great Britain have exhibited a troubling failure and cancelation rate. Of the 26 Musical Kickstarters, 16 of them were either canceled or failed (**38% success rate**). The majority of these failures were due to oversized funding goals. Less than 25% of the Kickstarters in this category received more than £1,500. On average, these Kickstarters only received £1,047 in funding. **I would not reccomend that Louise starts a Musical Kickstarter with a goal of £4,000**. If Louise does eventually decides to persue a Musical Kickstarter in this market, I would reccomend having a maximum funding goal under £1,000. As the size of the funding goal decreases, the chances of success will increase.
