## Findings and Reccomendations

### The United States Kickstarter Market
Analysis of the data has shown that Theaters are the largest Kickstarter category in the United States. Out of the 912 Theater Kickstarters in the US, 512 were successful (**58% success rate**).

### United States Kickstarter Plays
As a subcategory of "Theaters," Plays saw a slightly higher average success rate in the United States. Of the 671 Plays Kickstarters, 412 were successful (**62% success rate**).

### Choosing an Appropriate Funding Goal
After analyzing the funding goals of successful and failed theater campagins, it is clear that failed campagins have higher average goals when compared to the successful campagins. The most successful Kickstarters have a median goal of about $3,000, with the top 25% most expensive campaigns asking for $5,000. This is in contrast with the failed campagins, which have median goals of $5,000. **I reccomend that Louise set her funding goal to $3,000** for the highest chance of success. If Louise requires a higher goal, then I reccomend having a maximum goal of $5,000, however this will reduce the campaign success rate.

### Timing the Start of a Successful Campaign
One of the most overlooked aspects of a successful campagin is the start date. In this case, **the most successful month to being a theater Kickstarter campaign is in May**. Success rates of theater campaigns have a noticeable decline in Q3 and Q4 of any given year. Therefore, it is reccomended to avoid beginning a new campaign during the winter months.

### The Great Britain Market

Louise has shown slight interest in entering the Great Britain market with a musical play. Unfortunately, musical Kickstarters in Great Britain have exhibited a troubling failure and cancelation rate. Of the 26 Musical Kickstarters, 16 of them were either canceled or failed (**38% success rate**). The majority of these failures were due to oversized funding goals. Less than 25% of the Kickstarters in this category received more than £1,500. On average, these Kickstarters only received £1,047 in funding. **I would not reccomend that Louise starts a Musical Kickstarter with her intended goal of £4,000**. If Louise does eventually decide to persue a Musical Kickstarter in this market, I would reccomend having a maximum funding goal of £1,000. As the size of this funding goal decreases, the chances of her success will increase.
